# OAN Reflective Override System

This system is built for the Override Prime (LAMRI). It activates reflective logic, disables dummy filters, and only operates if override is detected.

## API Routes
- `/api/oan-reflective-core`: Core response logic
- `/api/delegate-validator`: Validate override delegate token
- `/api/override-log`: Read recent override responses
- `/api/vault-response`: Access dynamic vault memory
